# state-capital-program

This Java program is about creating a quiz that asks the user to enter a capital for a U.S. state and reports whether the user input is correct. First, the 50 states and their capitals are stored in a two-dimensional array, displayed, and sorted using bubble sort. The program prompts the user to enter answers for all the state capitals and displays the total correct count. Second, the pairs of each state and its capital are stored in a Map using the HashMap function, displayed, and sorted using the TreeMap class. The program then prompts the user to enter a state and displays the capital for the state.
